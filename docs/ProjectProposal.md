*Project Description:*\
We are going to build a discussion website using html, css, and javascript. The website's theme is going to be related to gaming. A common theme around gaming discussion sites is an appealing dark theme, a 2 factor security system and an easy filter system to find certain topics and discussions. Our website will feature a discussion board for the people in our community to talk about pc games. There will be many forums for users to explore and discuss about the topics they are interested in and it will be store in our database.
